# ruxel

ruxel is a voxel rendering engine but will probably end up as a minecraft clone. 
it's written in rust.

## TODO
* player object instead of moving the camera
* collision
* better landscape generation
    * https://github.com/Razaekel/noise-rs/tree/develop/examples
    * the complex planet example is good but it takes ~14 minutes to generate.  downressing to 512x512 takes ~5 minutes.
* chunks
* save/load world to disk
* more block types
* specular lighting
* shadow mapping
* transparent blocks
* textures?
* creatures
* dynamic world
